Headlights illuminate your path when it's raining or when you're driving at night. Headlights use halogen, LED, or high-intensity discharge (HID) bulbs to generate light. They have a low-beam setting and a high-beam setting. High beams come in handy when you're driving at night on an isolated and unlit road.

The most important car lights are headlights. The two types of headlights are low beam and high beam, which allow drivers to see the road in the dark and make themselves visible to other motorists. Other car lights include DRLs, sidelights, and fog lights.
