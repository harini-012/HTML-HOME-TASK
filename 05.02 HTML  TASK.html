<!-- The bookstore is launching a new mystery novel and wants to create a basic web page with
an exciting welcome message, a description of the book, and a section that highlights the
services provided by the bookstore. The page needs to be visually engaging, so we’ll use color
to emphasize key sections.
Requirements :
• The Welcome Message (<h1>) will have a bold, exciting color (e.g., darkgreen).
• The Book Description (<p>) will have a calming color (e.g., darkslategray).
• The Services Section (<p>) will have a distinct color to separate it from other content
(e.g., mediumvioletred).
• The background color of the page will be light to give the page a clean, modern look
(e.g., lightyellow).
• Include any images of your choice in the page-->

    <p> A bookstore is a haven for book lovers, offering a diverse collection of literature, from timeless classics to modern bestsellers. Shelves lined with novels, biographies, poetry, and academic texts invite readers to explore new ideas and stories. The soft rustling of pages, the scent of freshly printed books, and the cozy ambiance create a welcoming atmosphere. Many bookstores also feature reading nooks, where visitors can lose themselves in a book before making a purchase. Some even host author signings, book clubs, and literary discussions, fostering a sense of community among readers. Whether one seeks knowledge, inspiration, or simply a quiet escape, a bookstore is a place where stories come to life.</p>
