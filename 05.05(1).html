<!--
. You are a front-end developer for a company that wants to easily switch between branding
themes (e.g., for different product lines or seasonal events). Your task is to build a web page
that supports switching between two themes — "Default" and "Summer" — using CSS
variables.
Define Global Variables in :root:
• Colors: --primary-color, --secondary-color, --bg-color, --text-color
• Typography: --font-family, --font-size
• Spacing: --padding, --margin
Apply Variables to a Simple Layout:
• Header with company name
• Navigation bar with 3 links
• Content section with heading, paragraph, and call-to-action button
• Footer
Add a .summer-theme Class:
• When applied to <body>, it should change the color scheme to a summer palette (e.g. warm
orange and yellow tones)-->
